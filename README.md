# AITicTacToeConnect4
This repository contains Python implementations of two classic games, Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4, as well as two reinforcement learning algorithms, Minimax with alpha-beta pruning and tabular Q-learning, that can learn to play these games. Also, the repository includes a default opponent that plays against the algorithms and can block winning moves.
